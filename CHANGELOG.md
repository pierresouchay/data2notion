# Changelog for data2notion

## Upcoming

## 1.3.0 - 2025-06-12

FEAT:

- allow scripted evaluations for `--delete-policy`, `--update-policy` and `--add-policy`.
  It used to allow: APPLY|IGNORE|CONFIRM values, but it can now evaluate some python expressions.
  Such expression might return `True` or `"APPLY"` (APPLY), `"CONFIRM"` (CONFIRM) to ignore a change:
  `"IGNORE"` or `False`. Both notion and records top be synchronized are supported, namespaced in dicts
  called `notion` and `src`. Thus, checking attribute first_name from notion can be accessed that way:
  `--delete-policy=notion["first_name"].startswith("crap")` to delete all entries starting with `crap`.
  This opens very complex synchronizations mechanisms, more flexible than the `--partition` mechanism.


## 1.2.0 - 2025-06-10

FIX:

- make `--partition` option work again + added metrics to track ignored fields

## 1.1.0 - 2025-06-03

PERF:

- improve comparisons for multi-select booleans -> fewer updates
- revamp translation of values from plugins

FEAT:

- when `--notion-log-level DEBUG` is used, display all changes
- properly compute progression when using a policy with IGNORE

## 1.0.15 - 2025-05-21

FIX:

- avoid isses when comparing 0 and empty value when comparing on diffs

## 1.0.15 - 2025-05-21

PERF:

- Improve performance for diffs when None or [] was compared to empty data (eg: '')
  will sync fewer data
  

## 1.0.14 - 2025-05-07

FEAT:

- Improve prometheus error messages for connection issues / NameErrors

## 1.0.13 - 2025-04-09

PERF:

- fix bug in diff that caused too many records to be updated
  when source had no value (None): huge improvements on large CSV
  files imports

## 1.0.12 - 2025-04-09

FIX:

- fix buggy plugin filtering that cause import/export plugins to fail

## 1.0.11 - 2025-04-09

FEAT:

- [jagu-sayan](https://github.com/jagu-sayan) added feature to export Notion into CSV
  This feature supports CSV plugin only for now and can be used with `export-from-notion` command.

## 1.0.10 - 2025-04-07

PERF:

- Propery compare timestamps of source/notion when source is more precise
  than notion (which has minute-level granularity) -> fewer diffs -> more performance  

## 1.0.9 - 2025-03-24

FEAT:

 - Support for partitioning synchronization
   using `--partition tags=(tag1|tag2)` will now only sync elements from
   source and destination when their property named 'tags' contains either tag1 or tag2.
   This is helpful to partially synchronize several CSV files into the same database for instance.
   This supports regexp, so possible to use `--partition 'tags=prefix1.*'` for instance

## 1.0.8 - 2025-03-18

FIX:

 - bump asynciolimiter â‰¥ 1.1.2 to fix possible deadlock when performing many updates

## 1.0.7 - 2025-03-10

FEAT:

 - improve progressbar during updates

FIX:

 - improve possible deadlocks for databases with huge number of entries to update
 - dependency for notion_client to 2.x version

## 1.0.6 - 2025-03-06

PERF:

 - added `--notion-rate-limiter` option to specify rate limit

FEAT:

 - added progressbar (can be deactivated with --no-progress-bar)

## 1.0.5 - 2024-10-16

PERF:

 - Properly diff multi-select to avoid always trying to update values

## 1.0.4 - 2024-06-26

FEAT:

 - Detect Too many requests and shutdown immediatly
 - Display URL, title and information at startup when syncing
 - Improved display of statistics

## 1.0.3 - 2024-06-25

 - added --version to show current version information

## 1.0.2 - 2024-06-25
