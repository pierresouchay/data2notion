# Changelog for data2notion

## Upcoming

## 1.0.12 - 2025-04-09

FIX:

- fix buggy plugin filtering that cause import/export plugins to fail

## 1.0.11 - 2025-04-09

FEAT:

- [jagu-sayan](https://github.com/jagu-sayan) added feature to export Notion into CSV
  This feature supports CSV plugin only for now and can be used with `export-from-notion` command.

## 1.0.10 - 2025-04-07

PERF:

- Propery compare timestamps of source/notion when source is more precise
  than notion (which has minute-level granularity) -> fewer diffs -> more performance  

## 1.0.9 - 2025-03-24

FEAT:

 - Support for partitioning synchronization
   using `--partition tags=(tag1|tag2)` will now only sync elements from
   source and destination when their property named 'tags' contains either tag1 or tag2.
   This is helpful to partially synchronize several CSV files into the same database for instance.
   This supports regexp, so possible to use `--partition 'tags=prefix1.*'` for instance

FIX:

 - bump asynciolimiter â‰¥ 1.1.2 to fix possible deadlock when performing many updates
